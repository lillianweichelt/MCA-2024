\[Title: Dawn, Project: Pride and Prejudice, Composer: Dario Marianelli, Time Period: 2005\]

\[There are quite a few struggles with working with music. One main one is if your selected pieces are not in the public domain. This makes it almost inaccessible and causes one to look either for free transcriptions or scans. The issue with transcriptions is that it may not always be accurate. Even if the score is easily accessible, the composer could be using unfamiliar techniques that a program like Cusescore cannot understand or reproduce.\]

\[The musical score I have found for my theme is a somewhat poor scan of a piano book for the Pride and Prejudice soundtrack. There are shadows and some measures have been slightly cut off. With some musical knowledge, listening to the audio recordings and looking at the metadata will fill these gaps. As a simple example, the name of the composer in the musical score was cut off, so I looked at my metadata and was able to fill in this information.\]
